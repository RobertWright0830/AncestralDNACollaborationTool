Look into specialized bot to perform this.

Combine mine, Jon's and Uncle Richards all to one database.
Look at all chromosomes  and identify paternal and maternal shared matches.

Add in inferred column and 5 ancestor columns. These ancestor columns should be labeled as jon and mine's 'parents', the next column is grandparents, next is greats, then 2xgreat, then 3xgreat, then 4xgreat.
Add on tree column.

All x's for jon and i are pink in parents. Use a vlookup function for these. Note inferred based on x chromosome. 

All uncle richard x are big mama's ancestors descendants. 

Sort by url and look for more occurrences of those identified due to x and copy them down to other listing of same url.

All shared with uncle richard are blue. Use vlookup. Note inferred based on uncle richard match. Filter these matches and sort by url, chromosome and tester name. If same overlapping location just note based on richard match. If different location, assumed based on uncel richard connection but different location. This same process could be used instead of uncle richard for anybody we can get file for.

Do the above in the same way i idnetified shared matches with uncle richard. In other words, sort all of Uncle Richard's matches for all chromosomes based on url where the segment is larger than the 10cm amount calculated below. Highlight that range and call it Richard. Add 5 columns for all to represent my ancestors. For all of uncle richards, initially mark gray. Then for mine and Jon's matches, do a vlookup that marks all matches in blue. Filter for all of mine and Jon's in blue and name that range burl. Do a vlookup off all of uncle richards placing the formula in the gray cells. Where there is a match, change those cells to blue and delete the formulas from the column. Although remaining gray are likely pink, wait for positive confirmation to be sure. It could just be areas where we dont have any shared matches, errors, or timing of when reports were ran (ideally you want these reports all ran at the same time), or restrictions on visibility. Even though isolating for 1 chromosome, matches should be considered across all chromosomes. If matching in same location, safe to assume, but elsewhere is being inferred.

When 23andme is back up, can look at shared matches of remaining known ancestors to help identify known maternal or paternal side. 
Start with largest unknown matches, select and find 2 known ancestors in their specific segment looking into. From 23andme chromosome tool, see which match for that segment. If other matches reveal the same segment, note as the parent they connect through. Note inferred based on 23andme chromosome tool match. Consider running this down to all 20 or more cm matches with individual pieces more than 10 cm.

Identify from db where jon and i have no match, half match and full match and place bars on the chart. These would look the same on 2 different website pages (1 jon, 1 rob). For excel purposes, use the format i have already set up. In ranges where Jon and I match, identify if match is mom's side or dad's by seeing if we have matches in those segments. Use similar shading scheme already used for excel purposes. For db, filter for jon and robert, specific chromosome, and start less than larger amount minus whatever 10cm is, and end less than smaller amount plus whatever 10cm is. For each of these groupings, mark as red if no overlap between jon and robert, yellow if half match, and green if full match. For yellow, see which ones match robert, 






From the pared list of matches for Jon and I, attempt to break up between big mama M and big daddy P.




See if anybody, especially uncle richard or first cousins extend beyond where the break occurs. If so, then those are the same pieces.

Identify all that are known to be big daddy's relatives or big mama's. That will tell us who each segment belongs to.

So to recreate dad's this would be similar to the slides. Where Jon and I are different we have dad's mom and dad's dad. If we have the same then we only have either the piece dad got from his mom or dad. That can be determined by identifying a known match in that section. If no known match, to see whether jon or i have an extension of more than 5 cm (or some other reasonable number that doesnt extend back to where we again overlap. Want to avoid small changes between jon and i where the overlap may be back to the original) over that line and see if the extension has a known match. If so, then that tells us who the overlapping piece belongs. Do this for every chromosome. We will then have a significant amount of dad's dna except where jon and i overlap we will be missing the other side. Some of that missing dna will be picked up from gina.

Focus on one pair of siblings at a time.

Once we have all siblings complete, move on to the next generation.

Although db is the same, chart will be new one. Set up new excel file that uses same templates used for Jon

Also have ways to mass update

Add column for source
Add column for other sites and name there
Add column for links (facebook, web searches...)
Add 3 closest matches column
Review those with ancestry link through 23andme
Could help in determining side



Only pieces greater than whatever average count is between markers where cm is 10. Calculate this at each chromosome.

For each choice of p or m have a option to add why inferred

Provide un

Free load your own and others and do it yourself, but see where other shared matches are in gray. 

Paid includes automated process and ability to see others you share with.

Additional ability to allow others to see yours that you approve. But ability to prevent visibility even if paid. For these people shade differently to nonpay viewers so they dont pay under false premises.

Show chatgpt an example of what the chromosome painting should look like and say i want the results in that format, as well as a data table.

Set up wwbsite so you drag your file, and list any known relationships to you, or known relationships to each other from list of names loaded.

Another output chatgpt could create is a fanchart based on amount of dnA

Each chromosome bar on bottom is broken up into layers, depending on how far back you go. So if you just have your dna identified to your parents just solid pink or blue layer. If you have to grandparents, then you have 2 layers. So layers get thinner and thinner the further back you push your segment.
